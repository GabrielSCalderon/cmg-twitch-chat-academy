Chris’s Running List of Expectations (not in any particular order):
| Rule  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. English Only  | Chris uses a chat overlay, so if he doesn't understand what you send, it must be removed.  |
| 2. No Politics | General rule is any event/topic younger than 50 years old is too political for the stream.  |
| 3. No X vs Y Wars | General rule is any event/topic younger than 50 years old is too political for the stream.  |
| 4. Respect All Coding Languages  | No degrading or meme-ing programming languages.  |
| 5. Be Self Reliant  | Do your own research and work instead of asking for handouts or answers. Chris does not have a Q&A stream.  |
| 6. Objective Questions Preferred  | Don’t ask subjective questions like how difficult something is or what tech tools Chris prefers.  |
| 7. Watch Before Asking | Don’t ask Chris blanket questions like “what are you making.” Read the stream title and watch the stream first.  |
| 8. On-Topic Chat Preffered  | Avoid interrupting Chris's conversation flow. Sometimes during heavy computing or app compilation, Chris will reach out and ask how people are doing and what they are up to.  |
| 9. Backseating Only Upon Request  | No backseating unless Chris specifically invites it beforehand.  |
| 10. Experience is Not Proficiency  | Don’t ask Chris how long he's been programming for because it shouldn’t matter.   |
| 11. Clarify All Humor  | For jokes, sarcasm, or light-hearted comments, clearly indicate your message’s intent with things like lol, emojis, etc. Otherwise, you can easily be mistaken for malicious or hyperbolic intent.  |
| 12. Maturity Preffered  | You will be judged on the maturity of your message, even if you’re new to stream.   |
| 13. Prioritize Current Goal  | All new app features or project suggestions when Chris is currently working on one should be softly delivered. Best to save ideas for when Chris is between tasks or when he asks how everyone is doing.  |


Chris’s Running List of General Principles (not in any particular order):
1. Premature optimization is the root of all evil
2. Avoid biased or subjective takes on technology
3. Avoid decision paralysis and try all tech tools
4. Avoid hyperbolic opinions and emotional connections to technology
