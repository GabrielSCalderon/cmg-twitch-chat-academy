# Chris Griffing's Twitch Chat Academy
## Written by VeloTheHero

A collection of the various norms and etiquettes practiced and expected by Chris Griffing's twitch chat community. This is an ongoing project aimed at capturing Chris's unwritten rules of engagement for his software development stream on Twitch.


1. English Only
  - Chris uses a chat overlay, so if he doesn't understand what you send, it must be removed.
2. No Politics
  - General rule is any event/topic younger than 50 years old is too political for the stream.
3. Respect All Coding Languages
  - No degrading or meme-ing programming languages.
