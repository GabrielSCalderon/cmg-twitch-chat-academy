# Chris Griffing's Twitch Chat Academy
## Written by VeloTheHero

A collection of the various norms and etiquettes practiced and expected by Chris Griffing's twitch chat community. This is an ongoing project aimed at capturing Chris's unwritten rules of engagement for his software development stream on Twitch.


1. **English Only**: Chris uses a chat overlay, so if he doesn't understand what you send, it must be removed.
2. **No Politics**: General rule is any event/topic younger than 50 years old is too political for the stream.
3. **Respect All Coding Languages**: No degrading or meme-ing programming languages.
4. **Be Self Reliant**: Do your own research and work instead of asking for handouts or answers. Chris does not have a Q&A stream.
5. **Objective Questions Preferred**: Don’t ask subjective questions like how difficult something is or what tech tools Chris prefers.
6. **Watch Before Asking**: Don’t ask Chris blanket questions like “what are you making.” Read the stream title and watch the stream first.
7. On-Topic Chat Preffered: Avoid interrupting Chris's conversation flow. Sometimes during heavy computing or app compilation, Chris will reach out and ask how people are doing and what they are up to.
